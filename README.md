# Measure-distance-with-LEDs-using-ultrasonic-hc-sr04-sensor-

The Ultrasonic sensor is very popular and used to measure the distance to an object. It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver modules. Hc-sr04 transmit high-frequency sound and when an object detects then reflect the signal to echo.

Features:

Distance measure:- 5cm to 35cmüìè.
Power Supply: +5V DC.
Measuring Angle: 30 degree.
uses as: Obstacle avoiding robot, distance measure, measure water level and many more.

Requirement:
1. Arduino Uno. 
2. Ultrasonic sensor Hc-sr04.
3. 7 x LEDs.
4. 7 x 220ohm resistor.
5. Breadboard.
6. Hookup wires.
